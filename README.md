====================
Project 1 for cs327e

The shared test repository is public, which means you could git clone or download the test cases. :)
But please let me know your Github id by iniviting me to your private repo, so you could pull/push your test cases (EID-***.py/in/out) to public repo. 
<I will invite people at the end of each day, please email me if you dont have acess one day after you invite me.>
Thanks!~ Good luck!~~
